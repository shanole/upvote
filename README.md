## Description

<details>
    <summary><span style="color:red"><strong>Expand to Read User Stories</strong></summary>

1. As a user, I want to enter content into a form and submit to create a new post.
2. As a user, I want my new posts to include a timestamp. And I want to see when other listings were posted, too.
3. As a user, I want to upvote posts I particularly enjoy.
4. As a user, I want to downvote posts I don't like, or find inappropriate.
5. As a user, I'd like posts with the most upvotes to appear higher on the page. (We haven't explicitly covered this in our curriculum, but here's a hint: You can complete logic before the return statement of a mapStateToProps() method!)
