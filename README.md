1. As a user, I want to enter content into a form and submit to create a new post.
2. As a user, I want my new posts to include a timestamp. And I want to see when other listings were posted, too.
3. As a user, I want to upvote posts I particularly enjoy.
4. As a user, I want to downvote posts I don't like, or find inappropriate.
5. As a user, I'd like posts with the most upvotes to appear higher on the page.
